# HTMLHellYes
Free Speech is a disease. This is the cure.

So each file represents one line to be executed on the JS command console opened at ESR's HTML Hell page (http://catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html) This project is of literally no value to anyone; well, it is of value in terms of getting some experience in handhacking pages from the console using jQuery, which really is a pretty practical skill for web devs. But that was not really my purpose going in and any learning has been entirely incidental to my real goal: play. Play!
